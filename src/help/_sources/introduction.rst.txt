NetUse2 is a network diagnostic tool to troubleshoot and identify potential network
issues quickly.  NetUse2 can also be used to monitor network speeds over long periods
of time to help determine periods of network congestion for further troubleshooting.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Java Runtime Environment 11
- Windows or Linux Operating System for data export/retrieval
- A network connection

Operational Modes
-----------------

NetUse2 has two modes of operation:

    -   Analysis Mode:
        In Analysis Mode, NetUse2 will automatically attempt to troubleshoot common network issues
        and display the findings to the user.


    -   Duration Mode:
        In Duration Mode, NetUse2 will use a user-specified target and duration to map reply times
        over the specified duration.  This capability will help identify periods of network congestion
        or resource downtime for further analysis.
